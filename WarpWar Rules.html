                   Tactical Spaceship Design and Combat

                               2nd Edition

                      Game Design by Howard Thompson
                          (c) 1977 by Metagaming
                   Revised 1994 by WarpWar Design Group
</pre>

<h2> I. INTRODUCTION </h2>

   WarpWar is a two- or multi-player game of tactical space combat
suitable for realtime, PBM or PBEM.  Players build their own unique
ships, move them between stars, and resolve combat without dice.  The
object of the game is to eliminate the opponent.  Solitaire playability
is nil. <p>
   WarpWar simulates a hypothetical future when time for flights between
stars is huge...but ends in brief but violent combat.  Warpships can
enter the stressed space channels ("warplines") between stars for nearly
instantaneous travel.  Nevertheless, wars among the stars last so long
that huge advances are made in technology.  Older ships are at a
disadvantage against newer ones. </p><p>
   The destructive power of weapons technology has become so great that
space combats have become tactical guessing games between ship
commanders.  A clear hit will wreck or cripple all but the most powerful
ships.  The goal, then, is to outguess the enemy - to use your own
weapons in the optimum manner where his defenses are weakest, while
avoiding a killing counterblow. </p><p>
   Battles are fought for control of resource-producing star systems.
Bases are built on systems to exploit the resources and to construct new
ships, but the bases have no other defenses.  The battle for a star is
over when its sky is swept clean of ships; the planetary bases will be
helpless. </p><p>
   Are you man enough to accept the challenge of WARPWAR?

</p><h3> II. GAME ELEMENTS </h3>

   To play a game of WarpWar you will need a star map and these rules.
For playing face-to-face, a set of counters must be created.  Counters
should be clearly marked to distinguish players' fleets from one
another, and to distinguish Warpships from Systemships.  A number/letter
system is the best for this purpose; Warpships can for example be
identified as W1, W2, W3 etc. and Systemships as S10, S20, S30 and so
forth. <p>
   A star map is included at the end of this file.  Guidelines for
creating new maps can be found in section VII. PBEM.  The map is divided
into hexes which control movement, and the hexes are numbered to
identify the hexes.  Hexes are further distinguished by stars and
warplines </p><p>
</p><pre>
  &gt;--&lt;
 /SUSA\    STAR HEX is the term used for all hexes containing a star.
(1)*   &gt;   Stars are named and referred to by hex number and name.
 \1207/    The numbers in parentheses is the star's basic econ. value.
  &gt;--&lt; 

  &gt;--&lt;
 /    \  SPACE HEX is the term used for any hex on the map that does
&lt;      &gt; not contain a star.  If a hex has a warpline in it but no star,
 \1007/  it is just like any other space hex.  Space hexes are referred
  &gt;--&lt;   to by their hex number.

             &gt;--&lt;
            /  * \
        &gt;--&lt;  //  &gt;
       /    //   /
   &gt;--&lt;   // &gt;--&lt;      WARPLINE is the term used for the lines
  /    \//  /          connecting some stars.
 &lt;    //&gt;--&lt;
  \  * /
   &gt;--&lt;
</pre>
<h4> PLAY </h4>
   In order to set up WarpWar for face to face play, each player must
select one set of ship counters.  Players then decide who will move
first; the player moving second chooses which end of the map will be
his/hers to defend.  The three stars at a player's end of the map are
his/her starting Base stars.  The two scenarios below differ in
complexity.  When you are familiar with the game, you may want to design
your own scenarios.

<h4> BASIC SCENARIO </h4>
   Each player starts the game with 40 Build Points and receives 8
Build Points at the start of each turn thereafter.  Each player has only
one Base, in the middle of his/her end of the map.  The first player to
destroy the opponent's Base is the winner.  Base construction, Holds,
Repair Bays and Technology rules are not used.

<h4> ADVANCED SCENARIO </h4>
   All rules are used.  Each player has three Bases, one on each of the
three stars at his/her end of the map.  Players get 20 Build Points at
the start of the first turn and receive Build Points at the start of
every turn thereafter in accordance with the economics rules.  The first
player to destroy the opponent's Bases is the winner. <p>

   Players who wish to develop more complicated rules to enhance their
enjoyment of WarpWar are encouraged to experiment.  WarpWar's modular
design is easily expandable.  A collection of rule variants is known to
exist.'

</p><h3> III. SEQUENCE OF GAME EVENTS </h3>

   Play alternates between players in turns.  A game-turn consists of a
player turn by all players.  A player-turn consists of a player going
through each of the events described below.  When one player has
completed his sequence of events, it is the next player's turn.
<p>
The sequence of game events for each player-turn is:
</p><ol>
<li> Build:
<ul>
<li>  (a) Receive new Build Points from owned stars according to the
      economics rules.  Add to stockpiles and record current base
      totals.  Load or unload system BPs into Holds.
</li><li> (b) Scrap old ships at bases and add Build Points to base stockpiles.
</li><li> (c) Build new ships and Bases, repair and resupply old ships.
      Subtract expenditures from Base totals  New ships are placed on
      the Star they were built at.
</li></ul>
</li><li> Movement: You may move some, none or all of your Warpships up to the
maximum movement (in hexes) of which they are capable.  Systemships may
be picked up or dropped off during this event at a cost of 1 Movement
Point per pickup or drop off action.
</li><li> Combat: Combat MUST occur whenever ships from opposing fleets occupy
the same star hex at the end of a player's movement event.  Combat in
each star hex is separate, and ends when only one player's or one
alliance's ship(s) occupy that star hex.  Combat does NOT occur when
opposing ships occupy the same non-star hex.
</li><li> Systemship Rearrangement: After all combats on all star hexes are
resolved, the player whose turn it is can have any Warpship drop off any
Systemship(s) it carries at the star it occupies, have any Systemship at
a star hex picked up by a Warpship there that has SRs, or transfer
Systemships from one Warpship to another at the same star hex.  This
event is essentially a free shuffling around of Systemships in a star
hex, and costs no movement.
</li></ol>

<h3> IV. SHIP BUILDING </h3>
   During the Build event of a player's turn, he collects BPs on all
owned systems, defined as systems with a friendly base or ship currently
stationed on it.  If a friendly Base is present, the player collects
double the BP value of that system and may stockpile the BPs on that
Base; if no Base is present, one half the basic BP value is collected
and the BPs must be immediately stored in a ship's Hold or they are
lost.  Systems produce BPs for a player beginning on the turn AFTER the
turn that player took ownership of that system.  For example, if Player
1 moves thought an unowned star it is now owned by Player 1 and produces
BPs at the start of Player 1's  next turn. If Player 2 moves through it
on his turn there are no BPs right away BUT it is now owned by Player 2.
If Player 1 now moves through it there are still no BPs but it is now
owned by Player 1.  BPs may not be transferred between Stars except in
Holds; BPs may not be transferred between ships.  He may use these BPs
to (a) build new ships, (b) repair old ships, (c) scrap old ships, (d)
build new Bases, or (e) resupply Missiles and Shells to old ships. A
player builds or repairs by expending Build Points from Base stockpiles.
Ships may be built and scrapped only at Bases.  Ships may be resupplied
and repaired at Bases or by Warpships equipped with Repair Bays.  The
Build Points are spent as explained below.  IT IS NECESSARY to make a
written record for each ship built, the damage it takes, and the repairs
and resupplies it needs.  A written record for each system's economic
expenditures is also required.

<h5> SCRAPPING SHIPS </h5>
   Ships may be scrapped for 1/2 their current total BP value.  Ships
may only be scrapped at Bases during the Build event.

<h4> SHIP ATTRIBUTES </h4>
   Warpships and Systemships may be built with the following attributes.
It is NOT necessary for a ship to have all these attributes.  If you
don't want a ship to have (for instance) Missiles, you just don't build
any.
<ul>
<li> POWER/DRIVE (PD) represents the total effective strength of a ship's
engines.  During movement, the PD of a Warpship divided by 2 and rounded
up gives its movement allowance in hexes.  During combat, the PD
strength of a ship is allotted to its drive and weapons so that those
may operate.  During combat, a ship may NEVER allocate power from PD in
excess of the available PD strength.  Each unit of PD strength costs one
BP to build.
</li><li> WARP GENERATOR (WG) is the unit that allows a ship to move from star
to star through space and to jump along Warplines.  A ship with a warp
generator is a Warpship.  Ships without warp generators are Systemships.
Warp generators cost 5 BP to build.
</li><li> BEAMS (B) represent the ability of a ship to project a beam of
destructive energy at a target.  Each ship may have only one Beam
projector.  The strength of the projector will vary according to the
number of Build Points spent on it.  The number of BP spent on the beam
is the maximum strength at which that ship's beam may be powered during
combat.
</li><li> SCREENS (S) represent the ability of a ship to surround itself with a
protective energy screen.  Screens reduce the number of "hits" damage
the ship must take when it is struck by an enemy weapon.  Beams and
Screens are manifestations of the same type of energy projection
generator.  Beam and Screen may be used simultaneously, but NEITHER may
be used on the same round that Missiles or Shells are fired.  The number
of Build Points spent on a Screen is the maximum strength at which that
Screen may be powered during combat.
</li><li> ELECTRONIC COUNTERMEASURES (E) cost 1 BP per point of ECM.  The ship
can allocate PD in combat to ECM, up to the ECM rating with which the
ship was constructed.  In combat, after orders are revealed, the player
using ECM allocates his ECM points among the attacking Missiles, and
then adds or subtracts the difference between the defending ship's tech
level and each Missile's tech level from the ECM points allocated to
that Missile.  ECM may be used in the same combat round with all other
ship systems.
</li><li> TUBES (T) are used by a ship to launch Missiles.  Each Tube may
launch one Missile per combat round.  It requires a PD allocation of 1
to power a Tube for firing.  Each Tube costs 1 BP to build.
</li><li> MISSILES (M) may be fired through a ship's Tubes at an enemy ship.
Each Missile does a basic damage of 2 hits if it strikes.  The number of
hits damage a Missile does may be modified by other factors as per the
combat rules.  One Build Point will build three Missiles.  A ship may be
built to carry any number of Missiles, and can never hold more than
initially specified.  As Missiles are fired, they must be subtracted
from the ship's Missile stock on that ship's record.  Missiles may not
be transferred between ships.
</li><li> ARMOR (A) is ablative hull reinforcement.  1 BP builds (2 + tech
level) points of Armor.  One point of Armor will absorb one point of
damage.  Armor is repaired at a cost of 1 BP per 2 points of Armor,
regardless of tech level.
</li><li> CANNONS (C) are used by a ship to launch Shells.  Each Cannon may
fire either one, two or three Shells per combat round.  1 PD is required
to power a Cannon for one combat round.  Each Cannon costs 1 BP to
build.  Cannons are treated as Beams as far as combat goes, i.e. ship's
drive setting is used on CRT, but they may not be used with Beams or
Screens.  May be used with Missiles.
</li><li> SHELLS (SH) are fired by Cannons.  Each Shell does a basic 1 point of
damage if it strikes.  Hit +1 and +2 and TL extra damage is added per
burst of Shells, not per individual Shell.  1 BP builds 6 shells.
Shells do not have a drive setting; they are unguided and act like Beams
in that they hit according to the ship's Drive and Maneuver.  In other
respects they are treated as Missiles - ship may carry any number, may
not be transferred between ships.  Shells are not affected by ECM.
</li><li> SYSTEMSHIP RACKS (SR) let a Warpship carry Systemships.  Systemships
may not have SRs and may not carry other Systemships.  A Warpship may
have any number of SRs and may carry one Systemship for each SR it has.
Each Systemship Rack costs one BP to build.  A Warpship may NOT be
carried in a Systemship Rack.
</li><li> HOLDS (H) cost 1 BP per 10 BP capacity.  Holds contain BPs and allow
Warpships to transport BPs between stars.  When taking damage, 1 point
of damage will destroy one 10 BP-capacity Hold AND 10 cargo BP, or
fraction thereof.  When taking damage on a Warpship with more than one
Hold, the player may choose to damage empty Holds before BP-carrying
Holds.  BPs may be loaded or unloaded during the Build event only.  BPs
may not be transferred between ships.  Systemships may not have Holds.
</li><li> REPAIR BAYS (R) cost 5 BP.  A ship with a Repair Bay may use BPs in
Hold or from Star to repair itself or any number of other ships present
on the same star hex during the build/repair event.  BPs mined from
Baseless Stars may be used immediately to repair by ships with Repair
Bays.  Repair Bays like Warp Generators do not take damage in combat and
are destroyed when the Warp Generator is destroyed.
</li></ul>

   BASES are not ship components.  They are built on stars during the
Build event.  Each Base costs 30 BP.  These BP need not all be spent in
the same turn, but they must be brought in Holds to the star on which
the Base is to be built.  A record must be kept of the progress of Base
construction on all stars.  If an enemy ship is present unopposed at the
end of the enemy's turn on the star where there is an incomplete Base,
that Base is destroyed and all BPs spent are lost.  BP received from a
star may not be used to build a Base at that star in the turn they were
received.  A Base doubles the basic BP production of a system.  A Base
is destroyed automatically when enemy ships are present unopposed on the
Star hex at the end of the enemy's turn.  One half of all BPs present on
the destroyed Base can be immediately picked up by ships in the system
if they have sufficient Hold space.   Any BPs not immediately picked up
are lost.  Only one Base may be built on each star hex. <p>

   BUILD POINTS (BP) are produced at stars according to the economic
value of each star.  They are spent to build Warpships, Systemships and
Bases, to repair ships, and to resupply ships with Missiles and Shells.
A written record is kept by each player for every ship he builds.
Players show these records to each other after (but not during) the
game.  A written record is also kept for each Base, denoting BPs
accumulated and spent. </p><p>
</p><pre>    Build Points build ship components according to this schedule:
1 BP = 1 unit of Power/Drive strength (PD)
       1 unit of Beam strength (B)
       1 unit of Screen strength (S)
       1 Tube for firing Missiles (T)
       3 Missiles
       1 unit of ECM capability (E)
       1 Cannon (C)
       6 Shells (SH)
       2 units of Armor (A)
       1 Hold (H)
       1 Systemship Rack (H)

5 BP are needed to build a Warp Generator or a Repair Bay.
</pre>

   WARPSHIPS are ships with warp generators.  Warpships may have any
ship component.  They may move from hex to hex on the star map and may
move along the warplines.  Warpships may also engage in combat, carry
Systemships, have Repair Bays and Holds.  A Warpship may select any
combat tactic.  Systemships carried by Warpships are noted by their
numbers on that Warpship's record.  If a Warpship is destroyed, all
Systemships and cargo it was carrying when destroyed are also destroyed.
<pre>
EXAMPLES:
   W2 is built during turn 3, which means its technological level is 0.
21 BP are used to construct it.  W2 cannot carry any Systemships (SR=0),
but does have beams of strength 3, screens of 2, one Tube and 3 Missiles
to fire, and two points of ECM.  W2 also has a Power/Drive strength of 7
to use for movement and to allocate to weapons and drive during combat.
W2's movement allowance is 4.  W2's ship record looks like this:
   W2: TL0  PD=7 S=2 B=3 T=1 M=3 E=2
   (This totals 16 BP.  Adding the cost of the warp generator, to make
   it a Warpship, brings the cost to 21 BP.

   W7 is built during turn 12, which means its technological level is 2.
23 BP are used to construct it.  It is built to be a freighter and
repair ship; it can't fight, since it has no Beams, Screens, Missiles or
Cannons.  W7's record looks like this:
   W7: TL2  PD=6 A=8 H=2 SR=3 R=1 (the numbers of any Systemships
carried by W7 would also appear here.)

   SYSTEMSHIPS do not have warp generators.  Systemships may not have
Holds, Systemship Racks, or Repair Bays.  They may exist only on star
hexes unless carried by Warpships.  When a Systemship is being carried
by a Warpship, its number is noted on the Warpship's record sheet, and
the Systemship's counter does NOT appear on the map.  Systemships may
NEVER move from one hex to another under their own power.  They must
always be carried by a Warpship, and may be dropped off at a star hex.
In combat, a Systemship may never select the RETREAT tactic; it can
escape from combat only if carried by a Warpship.

EXAMPLES:
   S20 is built during turn 2 (tech level 0).  It costs 20 BP.  It can
have no warp generator, Systemship Racks, Holds or Repair Bay.  Its
record is:
   S20: TL0  PD=7 B=5 S=5 E=3

   S55 is built during turn 9 (tech level 1).  It costs 4 BP; it is a
fighter-type gunship, with PD=1 to power the Cannon.  Its record is:
   S55: TL1  PD=1 C=1 SH=12
</pre>
<h4> TECHNOLOGICAL LEVELS </h4>
   The technological level (TL) for newly built ships increases one
level every six turns.  Ships always retain their original TL.  Ships
built on turns 1-6 are TL 0, those built during turns 7-12 are TL 1,
those built during turns 13-18 are TL 2, and so on. <p>
   In combat, ships add their TL to the number of hits their Beams,
Missiles and Shells (per burst) do.  For example, a TL 3 ship would add
3 hits to its Beam damage, 3 hits to each Missile damage, and 3 hits to
each burst of Cannon fire, when the weapon actually hit.  ECM is
affected by tech a little differently:  the player using ECM allocates
his ECM to incoming Missiles as desired.  The tech level of each Missile
is then subtracted from the tech level of the target ship, and the
difference is added to or subtracted from the ECM points allocated
against that Missile ONLY. </p><p>

   TECHNOLOGY IN COMBAT EXAMPLE: A tech level 2 ship fires with a Beam
strength of 4 and hits a tech level 1 ship.  The firing ship adds 2 to
its Beam strength of 4, for a total of 6 hits.  The target ship had
Screens powered at 3.  It adds its tech level of 1 to the Screen power
of 3, for a total of 4 hits absorbed by the Screen.  Subtracting 4 hits
absorbed from 6 inflicted leaves 2 hits the target ship will have to
take somewhere in its attributes and mark off its ship record before the
next combat round. 
</p><h4> REPAIR AND RESUPPLY </h4>
   Repair and resupply occurs during the Build event.  A ship must be on
a Base star hex or on a Star hex with a Repair Bay-equipped Warpship
present in order to be eligible for repair or resupply.  A Systemship
may be repaired or resupplied even when it is loaded onto a Warpship.
Build Points are spent for repair and resupply in the same way they are
spent when a ship is built.  One BP builds just as much for repair as
for original building, with the exception of Armor, which is repaired at
a cost of 1 BP per 2 points of Armor, regardless of tech level.  A ship
can be repaired PARTIALLY or WHOLLY up to its original strength in each
attribute, BUT NO MORE.  For example, a ship originally built at PD=7
and damaged so that its new PD is 2, may be repaired all the way up to 7
-- costing 5 BP -- or repaired to some PD lower than 7.  It can never be
repaired to over 7.  Its TL remains what it originally was. <p>
   Resupply of Missiles and Shells allows a player to replace a ship's
original stock of ammunition after some has been fired or destroyed in
combat.  One BP replaces up to 3 Missiles or up to 6 Shells.  A ship may
not be resupplied with more Missiles or Shells than it originally
carried.  Fractions of BPs left over after resupply are not saved.
However, one BP CAN be used to resupply (for instance) 3 ships with one
Missile each.

</p><h3> V. MOVEMENT </h3>

<pre>   During the Move event of a player's turn, he may move some, none, or
all of his Warpships up to their maximum movement allowance (= 1/2 PD),
taking any damage into account.  Warpships may pick up or drop
Systemships during movement, at a cost of one movement point per
Systemship dropped or picked up.  Ship counters are placed face up on
the map, with lettering visible.  Systemships are not placed face up on
the map while being carried by Warpships, but ARE placed on the
appropriate star hex when not being carried.
   Warpship movement is governed by the Power/Drive unit.  One half of a
ship's present PD value, rounded up, is the ship's store of Movement
Points.  A ship with an undamaged PD = 7 would have 4 Movement Points.
It costs a Warpship 1 MP to do any of the following:
   Move from one space or star hex to an adjacent hex
   Move the full distance along a warpline, from the star hex at one end
to the star hex at the other
   Drop off OR pick one Systemship

   A Warpship may NOT stop at any intermediate on the warpline when
using warpline movement.  Warpships may only enter warplines for
warpline movement at one end of the warpline, NOT in the middle
   Warpships must stop movement on any star hex occupied by an enemy
ship.  This applies to Warpships moving either normally or by warplines.
   Warpships may freely move through space hexes occupied by enemy
ships.
   In 'blind' games where movement is hidden, such as refereed PBEM
games, players may indicate in advance that they are going to drop
Systemships when their Warpship arrives at a specific star.  If enemy
ships are found to be present at that star, the Systemships are dropped
and available for use on the first round of combat.  If no enemy ships
are present the Systemships are still dropped.  The Warpship must have
sufficient movement points remaining to drop the Systemships.
   Warplines between stars are treated as space hexes for non-warpline
movement purposes.
   A Warpship whose PD is reduced to zero may not move.
   Movement points expended during the move event are not considered
"lost" or expended during the following combat event.  When combat
commences, a ship may allocate its full present PD strength.
   Ships may NOT move onto an enemy Base star during the first turn.

   WARPSHIP MOVEMENT EXAMPLE: W6 starts its movement on space hex 1720
(starting position is indicated by #, end position by %).  It moves onto
Umma (1 movement point), moves along the warpline to Girsu (1 movement
point), moves 3 space hexes to Kish (3 movement points), and stops.  It
expended 5 movement points.  Had it dropped a Systemship on any one of
those three stars, it would have expended one additional movement point,
for a total of six used in that move.
   Another example: W8 starts on hex 1919 and moves two hexes to 1717 at
a cost of 2 movement points.  W8 treated hex 1818 like any other space
hex, even though a warpline passes through 1818.

<h2> VI. COMBAT </h2>
<pre>   Combat MUST occur when ships of opposing sides occupy the same star
hex at the end of a player's movement.  Each contested star hex is
treated as a separate combat and is resolved separately.  The player
whose turn it is decides in which order he will resolve combats on
contested star hexes.  The combat on one star hex is resolved before
combat on the next star hex is begun.  The combat event of a player's
turn is over when combat on all contested star hexes has been resolved.

COMBAT ROUND SEQUENCE:
   1. Each player writes an order for each of his ships at that star
hex, keeping it concealed from his opponent.  Each order must include:
     (a) A combat tactic from the Combat Results Table (Attack, Dodge or
         Retreat)
     (b) A target enemy ship for Beam fire, if any
     (c) A target enemy ship for Cannon fire, if any
     (d) A target enemy ship for each Missile fired, if any, and each
         Missile's drive setting
     (e) A power allocation from PD to Beams, Screens, Drive (PD), ECM
         and Tubes (if Missiles are fired).  The sum of these
         allocations may not exceed the ship's total current PD.
     (f) Which Systemships, if any, the ship (if a Warpship) is to pick
         up or drop.
   2. When both players finish writing their orders, they show them to
each other.  Reading the Combat Results Table, in conjunction with the
ship orders, the players determine the result for each weapon fired.
   3. Players apply the results of weapon hits to the ships.  Any damage
a ship receives is immediately marked off its ship record.  Any ship
that has received enough hits to reduce all its attributes to zero,
except for the warp generator and repair bay, is destroyed.  Counters
representing destroyed ships are removed.
   4. Ships that successfully retreat are moved to any hex adjacent to
the star hex.
   5. If both players still have ships on that star hex, a new round of
combat is begun on that hex.  Writing, revealing and applying one set of
orders constitutes one combat round.
   6. Combat ends on a star hex when:
     (a) All of one player's ships there have been destroyed, or
     (b) All of one player's ships there have successfully retreated off
         that hex, or
     (c) Three consecutive combat rounds pass in which no ships take any
         damage not absorbed by Screens.  In that case, the player whose
         turn it is must withdraw all his ships from that star hex to
         any hex(es) adjacent to that star hex.  Systemships are assumed
         picked up by any Warpship the retreating player wishes.  If
         there are no Warpships capable of carrying a Systemship, the
         Systemship is destroyed.

POWER ALLOCATION AND SHIP ORDERS
   Each ship order describes a ship's actions during one combat round.
Much of the order will detail how much power is allocated from PD to the
other ship attributes.  The power allocated from PD is necessary for
those other attributes to operate.  No more power may be allocated to
attributes than is undamaged and available in the PD unit.  Drives,
Beams, Screens, ECM, Tubes and Cannons are the attributes that need
powering.  The Warp Generator, Missiles, Systemship Racks, Holds, and
Repair Bays do not need power in combat.

   POWER ALLOCATION EXAMPLE
   A ship was built with an original PD of 9.  In previous combat 3 hits
have been taken on that PD, reducing it to 6.  From that PD=6, the ship
allocates 1 to Drive (for maneuver during combat), 2 to Beams, 2 to
Screens, and 0 to Tubes.  This totals 5, so one is unallocated.  (The
ship could not power its Tubes to fire Missiles, since it was using 
Beams and Screens.)

   EXAMPLE OF BEAM FIRE
   W3 is going to fire its Beam at S25, using the attack combat tactic.
The order for this combat would look like this:
   W3 (TL0) ATTACKS S25: D=0 B=3 S=2 T=0
   (W3 also powered its Screens while allocating nothing to Drive or
Tubes.  W3 would have needed a minimum of PD=5 for this example.
Obviously, if W3 had not been built with a Beam of at least 3 and a
Screen of at least 2, it could not have carried out this order.  Beams
and Screens and ECM cannot be powered past their capacity, even if extra
power is available.)

   EXAMPLE OF MISSILE FIRE
   S25 fires back at W3, using a Missile and the Dodge combat tactic.
   S25 (TL0) DODGE: D=4 B=0 S=0 T=1
     M ATTACKS W3: D=3
   (Note that S25 needed a PD of at least five to execute this order.
The D=3 for the Missile did NOT come out of the firing ship's PD.  Also,
note that S25 did not designate a target of its own.  It dodged while
firing a Missile, and the MISSILE attacked W3.  When the Combat Results
Table (CRT) is read, the Attack tactic will be used for the Missile to
see if the Missile hit.)
   It may be helpful to think of a Missile as a little ship that exists
for only one combat round and always uses the Attack tactic.  The
Missile also has its own Drive unit, which can be set to any level of 1
or greater when launched, regardless of the PD of the firing ship.  A
Missile does a basic 2 hits of damage when it hits.

   EXAMPLE OF CANNON FIRE
   S32 fires at W3 using two Cannons and the Attack tactic.
   S32 (TL1) ATTACKS W3: D=3 C=1 (firing 3 shells) C=1 (firing 1 shell)
   (Note that the number of Shells fired by each Cannon must be
specified.  Each Cannon may fire up to 3 Shells per round.)

EXPLANATION OF COMBAT RESULTS

MISS: The MISS result means the weapons fired missed the target ship,
and no damage was done.
ESCAPES: The ESCAPES result means that the ship that selected the
RETREAT combat tactic successfully withdrew from its enemy and escaped.
In order to ESCAPE, a retreating ship must simultaneously obtain the
ESCAPE result against EACH enemy ship (not Missile) that fired on it.
HIT: The HIT result means that the Beam or Missile or Shell(s) fired at
the target hit it.  A Beam which hits does damage equivalent to the
power of the Beam, plus tech level.  A Missile which hits does 2 hits
damage, plus tech level.  Shellfire which hits does 1 hit of damage per
Shell, plus tech level per burst.  "HIT +1" and "HIT +2" mean you add
one and two hits, respectively, to the hits of damage inflicted by the
weapon.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

READING THE COMBAT RESULTS TABLE
   Beam or Cannon Fire: The appropriate cell from the CRT for Beam or
Cannon fire is read at the intersection of the target ship's combat-
tactic column and the firing ship's combat tactic row.  The specific row
is found by subtracting the target ship's Drive allocation from the
firing ship's Drive allocation and using the row corresponding to the
difference.
   Beam Fire Example: The firing ship selects the Dodge tactic,
allocates 3 PD to drives, and allocates 3 PD to Beam.  The target ship
selects the Attack tactic and allocates 2 to Drive with Screens
unpowered.  Subtracting the target's Drive of 2 from the firing ship's
Drive of 3 yields a +1.  The result from the CRT is read at the
intersection of the target ship's ATTACK column and the firing ship's
DODGE row at +1, +2.  The +1, +2 row is read because of the +1
difference between Drives.  (It also would have been read if the
difference was +2.)  The result at this intersection is "HIT".
   Cannon Fire Example: The firing ship selects the Dodge tactic,
allocates 3 PD to drives, allocates 1 PD to its Cannon, and chooses to
fire 2 Shells from the Cannon.  The target ship selects the Attack
tactic and allocates 2 to Drive with Screens unpowered.  Subtracting the
target's Drive of 2 from the firing ship's Drive of 3 yields a +1.  The
result from the CRT is read at the intersection of the target ship's
ATTACK column and the firing ship's DODGE row at +1, +2.  The +1, +2 row
is read because of the +1 difference between Drives.  (It also would
have been read if the difference was +2.)  The result at this
intersection is "HIT"  Both Shells hit.
   Missile Fire: The appropriate CRT cell for Missile fire is read at
the intersection of the target ship's combat tactic column and the
firing ship's ATTACK row.  (Missiles always attack.)  The specific ship
tactic row is found by subtracting the target's Drive allocation from
the Drive setting given to the MISSILE.  (Remember: A Missile may be
given any Drive setting of +1 or greater, at no PD cost except the 1 PD
needed to power its Tube.)
   Missile Fire Example: A Missile is fired and given a Drive setting of
4.  It attacks (as always).  The target ship selected the Attack tactic
and allotted 3 PD to Drive.  Subtracting the target's Drive allocation
of 3 from the Missile's Drive setting of 4 yields a +1 difference. The
CRT result is read at the intersection of the target's ATTACK column and
the firing ship's ATTACK (0, +1) row.  The 0, +1 row is read because the
difference between the Missile's Drive setting and target's Drive
setting is +1.  The result at that intersection is "Hit +2".
   ECM: After orders are revealed, the player using ECM allocates his
ECM points among the attacking Missiles, and then adds or subtracts the
difference between the defending ship's tech level and each Missile's
tech level from the ECM points allocated to that Missile ONLY.
   ECM Use Example: A ship of tech level 2 is attacked by a Missile
using a Drive rating of 3 and with a tech level of 3.  The ship selected
the ATTACK tactic, powered Drive to 3 and allocated 2 PD to ECM.
Normally the Missile would subtract the target's drive of 3 from its own
drive to get a difference of 0, then read the CRT at the intersection of
the ATTACK (0,+1) row and the ATTACK column, giving a result of Hit +2.
However the ship allocates its 2 points of ECM to the incoming Missile.
Subtracting the Missile's tech level of 3 from the ship's tech level of
1 gives a result of -1; this is applied to the ECM allocated to the
Missile, resulting in 1 effective ECM point.  The player using ECM
chooses to lower the Missile's Drive setting to 2.  This causes the
Missile to get a drive difference of -1 and to use the ATTACK (-1,-2)
row, resulting in just a Hit.

RECORDING SHIP DAMAGE FROM COMBAT
   When enemy weapons hit a target ship, that ship takes damage
cumulatively from all weapons (of all ships) that hit it in each combat
round.  The amount of power allocated to a ship's Screens, PLUS that
ship's technological level, is subtracted from all hits a ship receives.
(If the Screen is not powered, no tech level is added to the S=0.)  The
Hit + 1 and Hit + 2 results from the CRT add one and two hits,
respectively, to the hits a weapon inflicts.  One hit (if unabsorbed by
Screens) does one Build Point worth of damage to the target.  Warp
Generators and Repair Bays NEVER take damage in combat; when all the
rest of the ship is destroyed, the warp generator and repair bay
explode.
   After subtracting the hits absorbed by the target ship's Screen from
all hits scored on it, the remaining hits ("effective hits") are taken
somewhere in the target's attributes.  When all of a ship's attributes
are reduced to 0, the ship is destroyed.  Its counter is then removed
from the map.
   The player owning a ship decides where the hits are to be taken.

EXAMPLE
   A ship of technological level 0 has Screens powered at 4.  It takes 7
hits in one combat round (including tech level adjustments).  The Screen
absorbs 4 of the 7 hits.  The remaining 3 "effective" hits must be taken
in the ship's attributes.  This is done by subtracting directly from
Power/Drive rating, Beams, Tubes, Cannons, Missiles, Shells, Armor, ECM,
Holds and Systemship Racks.  Before and after records for one round
might look like this:
   BEFORE: W4: TL0  PD=7 B=3 S=3 C=1 SH=12 E=1 (a 22-BP ship, counting
           the generator.)
   AFTER: W4: TL 0  PD={7}6 B=3 S={3}2 C=1 SH={12}6 E=1
The player chose to take one hit in PD, one in Screens, and one in
Shells.  Since 6 Shells cost 1 BP, the one hit took out 6 Shells.  If a
ship has only one or two Shells left, it can use them to take a hit.
However, if a ship has 6 or more Shells, a hit in Shells must take out
6.  The same is true for Missiles, except that 1 hit of damage will
destroy 3 Missiles.

   Suppose W4 did not kill its enemy, but enters another round of
combat.  The enemy ship is S35, a TL1 Systemship.  It fired two Missiles
last round, and has attributes as follows:
   S35: TL1  PD=6 S=3 T=2 M={9}7
Combat orders for both ships are written out.  The players chose the
following tactics:
   S35 (TL1): DODGE D=4 T=2
      M1 at W4: D=3
      M2 at W4: D=4
   W4 (TL0): ATTACK D=2 B=2 S=1 E=1
The Systemship dodged and fired two Missiles, one at drive setting 3 and
one at 4.  The Warpship attacked, firing its Beam at 3 and putting up a
Screen with a strength of 1.
   Reading the CRT we see that both Missiles hit W4: one at ATTACK
(0,+1) and one at ATTACK (+2).  Those are, respectively, a Hit +2 and a
Hit +1.  S35 also adds one more hit to the damage inflicted by each
Missile because it is tech level 1.  Thus, the two Missiles that hit
each do a basic 2 hits of damage, plus one more for tech level, and add
the +2 and +1 from the CRT.  The two Missiles inflict 5 and 4 hits,
respectively, for a total of 9 hits.  W4 had ECM powered to 1, and
allocated that point of ECM to the first Missile.  However the Missile's
tech level of 1 is subtracted from W4's tech level of 0 for an ECM
modifier of -1, rendering W4's ECM ineffective.
   W4's Screen was powered at 1, which subtracts 1 hit from the 9 done
by the two Missiles -- leaving 8 effective hits.  (Since W4 is only tech
level 0, the Screen absorbed no extra hits.)  W4 must take 8 hits
somewhere in its attributes.  Its record at the end of last round looked
like this:
   W4: TL 0  PD={7}6 B=3 S={3}2 C=1 SH={12}6 E=1
After taking 8 hits, it looks like this:
   W4: TL 0  PD={7}6 B={3}0 S={3}0 C={1}0 SH={12}0 E={1}0
W4 has elected to preserve all the PD possible in order to make an
effective retreat attempt.
   (S35 took no damage, because W4 missed with its Beam fire.  The Drive
difference, subtracting S35's drive from W4's drive, was a -2.  Reading
the ATTACK (-1,-2) row for the firing ship and the DODGE column for the
target ship gives a result of MISS.


SYSTEMSHIP PICKUP AND DROP IN COMBAT
   A Warpship may pick up or drop Systemships during a combat round if
it allocates Drive = 0 and Screen = 0 and selects the Dodge or Retreat
tactic.  The Warpship may fire its Beam or power ECM while picking up or
dropping Systemships, but may NOT fire Missiles or Cannons.  A Warpship
may pick up or drop during one combat round as many Systemships as it
has undamaged Systemship Racks.
   Systemships dropped during a combat round may NOT fire weapons (or be
fired on) that combat round.
   Systemships picked up during a combat round may not fire any weapons
during that round, but may power Screens and ECM.  They may be fired
upon by enemy ships.
   If a Systemship was to be picked up by a Warpship on a given combat
round, but the Warpship is destroyed during that round, the Systemship
is not automatically destroyed, but remains on the star hex.
   If the Warpship dropping Systemships is destroyed on the round it
drops the Systemships, the Systemships are NOT destroyed.  If the
Warpship successfully retreats on the round it drops Systemships, the
Systemships stay in the star hex.

SYSTEMSHIP PICKUP AND DROP AFTER COMBAT
   After all combat on all star hexes has been resolved for a player's
turn, he may designate any Systemships he wishes picked up or dropped by
any Warpship on the appropriate star hex.  This is essentially a free
rearrangement of Systemships following combat, for the player whose turn
it was.
</pre>
<h2> VII. PBEM </h2>
<pre>
   WarpWar is especially suited to PBEM due to its diceless character.
Games may be played with a referee or without.  Refereed games are
usually run "blind"; that is, no player knows anything about other
players' fleets or stars, and possibly nothing about the map as well.
Three or more players may play this way.  Non-refereed games are more
suited to two players.  All moves and builds are "seen" (but BP and ship
attributes are still secret) and combat rounds are sent with a blank
screen or two preceding them so that the other player may write his
orders and resolve the round immediately.
   Referees of PBEM games must keep records for all ships, all stars and
all Bases in the game.  They must also keep records of how much each
player knows about all other players and about the map.

CREATING NEW MAPS
   New maps may be created if players desire a larger galaxy in which to
fight.  Get a large sheet of hex paper with at least 400 hexes.  Each
hex has a 1 in 12 chance of containing a star; roll 1d12 for each hex,
or roll 2d6 and give it a star only on a roll of 11 or 12.  However, do
not roll for a hex adjacent to an existing star.  Stars are never
adjacent.  Give each star a 1 in 4 chance of having a warpline to each
of the 4 nearest stars.  No star will ever have more than 4 warplines.
Players' home worlds should be assigned in one of two ways.  Either
spread them more or less evenly throughout the map, or distribute them
around the periphery of the map with none in the center.  Give each star
on the map a basic BP value.  A good range for BP values is 0-5, with
higher values being rarer.  Rolling 2d6 and dividing the result by 3 is
a quick method of assigning BP values.
   Overall the map should be as fair as possible to all starting
positions.  If the rolls give bad results, change them to produce a
playable map.
